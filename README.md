# bird-game-mobile
This project is a game developed in Unity that is similar to Flappy Bird. This is based off of the YouTube tutorial by Renaissance Coders, here: https://youtu.be/A-GkNM8M5p8. I have made many modifications to customize this to be my own version of a Flappy-Bird style game.

Development is ongoing, and this README will be updated as development progresses.
